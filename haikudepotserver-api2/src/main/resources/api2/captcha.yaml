  title: HDS Captcha API
  version: "2.0"
  description: >
    This API is to do with captchas.  A captcha is a small image that is shown to a user in order for the user to
    supply some textual response from the image in order to verify that the operator is likely to be human and not a
    computer.  This helps to prevent machine-hacking of systems.  This API is able to provide a captcha and other
    APIs require that a 'captcha response' is supplied as part of a request.  In general a captcha is valid for a
    certain length of time.

            This is a base-64 encoded image of the captcha.  It could, for example, be used with
            a data url to render the image in an "img" tag on a web page.
