    <title>Deployment</title>

    <para>
        This section outlines the approximate steps to deploy the web application-server.  The application-server
        build process produces a standard JEE "war" packaged web application.  In the typical haikudepotserver
        deployment, this will be launched with the <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty">Jetty</ulink> application
        server.  A special build of the Jetty application server called &quot;jetty-runner&quot; is used which
        contains the essential Jetty server elements packaged as a single java jar file.  This avoids the need to
        install the full Jetty distribution.

            The default database installs a user with the nickname of &quot;root&quot; with a known password of
            &quot;p4mphl3t&quot;.  This password <emphasis>must</emphasis> be changed before the system is made
            available over a network.

        <para>
            The API-related HTTP traffic into the application server uses basic or token bearer authentication.
            Either technique exposes authentication details in the request and response.  For this reason it is
            advised that HTTP traffic to and from the application server be transported as secure HTTP (https)
            in order to prevent a third party from reading the HTTP headers and extracting this information.

        Please see
        <link linkend="prerequisites">prerequisites</link> required for running this software and
        <link linkend="buildandrelease">information</link> about obtaining a build product and possibly also
        creating a release version.  The build product that you will require for deployment can be found at
        &quot;haikudepotserver-webapp/target/haikudepotserver-webapp-1.2.3.war&quot;.
        The leaf-name will vary depending on the release that is being build.  You should also refer to
        <link linkend="config">the configuration section</link>
        for details of the format and keys for the configuration file.  You will need to create a configuration
        file for your deployment.

        <title>Setting Up Repositories</title>

        <para>
            The application server will pull &quot;.hpkr&quot; files from remote repositories that contain
            information about the packages at that repository.  Authenticated as root, it is possible to use
            the &quot;hamburger&quot; link at the top of the home page to get to the repositories, to add a repository
            and to trigger the import of a repository.
        </para>

            The coloured lines represent scripted or automated data flows and
            the black more manual flows or processes.  There is a mix of
            automation and manual-intervention.

            <para>
                The hvif2png program is packaged as a tar-ball in the HDS source.
                It is build for the correct platform that the HDS Docker image will
                use as its base image.  This tar-ball is then included in the HDS
                source.

            <para>
                This process is driven by Python scripts in the HDS repository.
                Based on a template, it will render a Dockerfile into the
                source.  The Dockerfile contains the correct, coordinated
                versions of;

            <para>
                Now the source is checked out by hand at the release tag.  From
                this process, driven by the Maven build tool, a Java Application
                .jar file is generated.

            <title>Docker Image</title>
            <para>
                The source can again be checked out at the correct tag.  This
                provides a Dockerfile ready to go.  The Docker tooling is used
                to create the image.  This will use the files in the HDS source
                as well as resources from the internet to assemble a Docker
                image that can be run in Docker on a suitable virtual
                environment.  From the support/deployment directory;

        <section>
            <title>Testing the Docker Image</title>

            <para>
                To test the local Docker image before using it requires that
                a suitable database server is configured.  If the database
                is not available to the test docker container, it is possible
                to TEMPORARILY port-forward from the internal database to the external
                address so that the Docker contain can access the service.
                For example;
            </para>

            <para>
                <programlisting>ssh -L 192.1.1.1:5432:localhost:5432 user@192.1.1.1</programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                A shared volume is
                used to convey runtime secrets to the Docker container.  This
                contains a well-known file called &quot;hds_secrets&quot; and
                HDS reads this as it starts up.  First create the secrets
                volume;
            </para>

            <para>
                <programlisting>docker volume create secrets</programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                Either you can edit the &quot;hds_secrets&quot; file on the
                host machine or you can edit from a container that is running a
                shell.  An example of the file can be found in the deployment
                sources of the HDS project.  To edit it using a shell on a
                running container;
            </para>

            <para>
                <programlisting>docker run -it -v secrets:/secrets &lt;image-id&gt; /bin/bash</programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                The file to edit is /secrets/hds_secrets and as the image
                has no editor, it may be necessary to edit the file with
                the basic &quot;cat&quot; tool.
            </para>

            <para>
                <programlisting>cat - > /secrets/hds_secrets</programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                Use CTRL-D to terminate and write the output file.
            </para>

            <para>
                Now run the container;
            </para>

            <para>
                <programlisting>docker run -v secrets:/secrets -p 8080:8080 &lt;image-id&gt;</programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                It should now be possible to access the running HDS system from a
                browser on the host system using "http://localhost:8080".
