        <title>Application</title>

        <para>
            The application server is configured using a standard java properties file.  This same format is used in
            different ways for either an actual deployment or a development environment.
        </para>

        <para>
            A typical java properties file has the following general form;
        </para>

key2=value2</programlisting>

        <para>
            There are a number of keys which are described below.

                <para>
                    This configuration setting defines the code of the default architecture that should be shown.
                    Example values might be &quot;x86_gcc2&quot; or &quot;ppc&quot;.

                <para>
                    This configuration setting can have a value of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  When false,
                    the system will display a warning message on the user interface to indicate that the deployment
                    is non-production.

                <para>
                    This configuration setting can have a value of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  When true
                    (the default), the system will make basic efforts to protect against one client repeatedly
                    incrementing a package version's view counter.  This might happen when a user navigates
                    to view a package and then navigates away and back again.  With this value set as true, within
                    a window of time, these two visits would be considered to be the same in terms of incrementing
                    the view counter.

                    This tool is used to render HVIF icon data to PNG images that can be displayed on the web
                    site.  This value is optional, but if absent, no icons for packages will shown.  Instead,
                    placebo icons will be displayed.

                    This tool can be used in some situations to optimize PNG data; for example when configuring
                    icons for packages.  An example value might be &quot;/usr/local/bin/optipng&quot;.

                    This optional value can be configured to specify a minimum version value for the
                    HaikuDepot desktop application.  If a version of the desktop application attempts to
                    communicate with the server with a version lower than this value then the server
                    will return a 412 (precondition failed) HTTP status and a header that describes the
                    minimum version required.

                <para>
                    This value is the number of versions back in the past from which the derivation will consider

                    When deriving an aggregate rating for a package, if there are not enough user ratings then the
                    package will have no rating.  This value is the minimum threshold and has a default value of 3.

                    For example; this might be used to create the URL used to manage the password reset process.  The
                    URL base is included in the email body to users who have requested a password-reset.  This has to
                    be configured because the application itself does not know the path by which the HTTP request had
                    reached it.

                <para>
                    In the case of a development environment, this base URL might be something like

                    This shared key is used to sign the authentication tokens transmitted between the server and the
                    client.  This value is optional.  If it is not supplied then a random shared key will be used for
                    each launch of the application server.  Non-configured keys will not work where two or more
                    load-balanced application servers are employed.  Any random value can be used for this and a possible
                    way to create values is to use the command &quot;uuidgen&quot;.
