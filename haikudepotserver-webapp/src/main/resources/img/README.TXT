The 'generic' icons here are used when it is not possible for the HVIF representation to be rastered to PNG.  This icon was obtained from the Haiku source repository 2015-11-22 and was obtained from;

.../data/artwork/icons/File_Archive_HPKG

The icons were loaded into the 'Icon-o-Matic' application in Haiku and then exported to PNG.  Once in PNG format they were artifically coloured to make them red to signify that there is an issue.
